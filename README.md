# SatisfactoryCalc
Satisfactory Building Calculator

Created to help calculate the buildings needed for a target per-minute production of specified items in the game Satisfactory.

To use: If there are no components, enter them in the add component window.  Select the type of resource, type of building, any input or output (in parts per minute) and add.
        From there, select desired component and output amount, and the calculator will show you how many of what type of buildings you'll need.  This currently only works on 
        a basic level, overclocking and a better ratio management needs to be incorporated.
        
I had originally thought about siphoning data from the wiki for my components, but I wanted to leave it open to adding custom components for mod support (modular power plants anyone?) and things of that nature.  I also left the save file in generic text to let me edit it directly if I know what my component data is.

About 7 hours of work went in to this, all in all a solid base.

Features to add:
-Remove component
-Overclocking
-Belt speeds
-More production buildings
-Option to pull from the wiki

And more!
